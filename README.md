This repositiory contains all of my Java programs that I have written in Eclipse.
** A few projects are not my own. This should be easy to tell from any JavaDoc indication **

ExampleProjects - I DID NOT WRITE THOSE, I came across these and found them useful for learning.

RSBots - Macros I made to automatically play a game for me.

dataStructures - Multiple different data structures I have written and used in my projects.

src - Projects I made in college.
