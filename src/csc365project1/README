This program retrieves elevation information of 5000 weather stations from the NCDC. After loading, a GUI is launched and when a valid weather station location is entered, the 100 most similar weather stations are displayed along with their elevation and diffrerence from the input station.

The continuation of this project can be seen in "csc365project2"
