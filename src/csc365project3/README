This project starts with one central wikipedia page and follows links on the page to other wikipedia page, creating a directed spanning tree, which is then cached so it doesnt have to run the loader again. WARNING: the first time this application is loaded, it can take about 20 minutes to load all of the pages and create the tree. After the loading process, a GUI application is run, showing a list of 200 of the page titles. The user can then select which page they would like to start at and which page they would like to end at. If there is a connection between the two in the tree, then a separate graphing GUI application is displayed showing the shortest path between the two, along with the most similar page to the start and end pages based on word frequencies.
